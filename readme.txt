	Description: This project implements multiple data structures to demonstrate data addition, retrieval,
	and deletion times. Specifically, it implements a linked list of arrays, and for purposes of searching,
	a linear search through the linked list, followed up by a binary search through the resulting array
	is used. This kind of a data structure is called an Amortized Dictionary.
	
	The implementation uses template classes to make the code truly independent of the inputs it receives.
	For testing needs, an int implementation of main() is given in TestingDriver.java.
	
	This project is implemented as a solution to a problem set. Detailed description of the problem
	is available in AmortizedDictionary.pdf. The implemented code is available in Dictionary.java
	
	Code practices to note: Various classes have been used to build the solution. Note use of OOP
	practices for simplicity and reusability. Linked lists and arrays are the data structure used.
